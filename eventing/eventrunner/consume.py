"""KafkaConsumer loop for the requests topic. Hands off to Router.

Phase 1 rewrote this module. Phase 0's version built its `KafkaConsumer` eagerly
inside `run()` with no retry and committed each offset immediately after handing
the event to the Router. Both are wrong in Kubernetes:

  * §8.1 — pod start order is not guaranteed. KEDA may start a pod while the
    broker is rolling; construction raises, the consumer **thread** dies, and the
    main thread keeps running. The pod stays `Running`, reports healthy, consumes
    nothing, and the demo hangs with no error anywhere. So: bounded-backoff retry
    around construction, and the loop body is wrapped so no exception can end the
    thread — it reconnects instead.
  * RQ-1 — committing on receipt makes lag hit zero while the agent is still
    streaming, and KEDA then scales the pod away mid-run. So commits are
    deferred until the terminal event, via OffsetLedger.
  * §8.4 — the loop touches a heartbeat file every poll so an `exec` liveness
    probe can see a wedged thread that a process check cannot.
  * §16 Gap C — requests older than `max_request_age_s` are dropped rather than
    re-run, so a group whose offsets expired after a week idle does not replay a
    day of agent work.
