"""GitHub sign-in for the submit path: device flow, then who the token belongs to.

Stdlib only (`urllib`), as §1.1 requires.

**GitHub does not issue a verifiable token for user login.** The device flow
returns an *opaque* access token — no signature, no claims, nothing to check
offline. (The JWKS at `token.actions.githubusercontent.com` is for Actions
workloads, not users.) So EventBridge cannot verify a token locally; it has to
ask GitHub who holds it, via `GET /user`.

Three consequences, all deliberate rather than accidental:

* **Sign-in depends on GitHub being reachable.** A failed lookup is a `401`, not
  an allow. Failing closed is the only safe direction when the question is "who
  is this".
* **The cache is load-bearing, not an optimisation.** Without it every request
  costs an API call against a 5000/hour budget. It is keyed by a hash of the
  token, never the token, so a memory dump or a log line cannot yield a working
  credential.
* **No scopes are requested.** `GET /user` returns the login for an unscoped
  token, so the app asks for the least access that answers the question. Nothing
  here can read a repository.

The approved-user list is separate from authentication on purpose: `401` means
"I do not know you", `403` means "I know you and you are not on the list". Those
are different answers and collapsing them tells an operator less.
