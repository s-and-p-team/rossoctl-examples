class Producer:
    """Publishes requests, and group lifecycle events onto the responses topic.

    §11: when a seed is configured, every event published here is signed under `kid`
    before serialisation, so EventRunner can refuse a request from anything that is
    not an approved submitter. `kid` rides in the JWS protected header, which is
    signed input — it cannot be swapped to impersonate another key.

    **Cost.** The Ed25519 here is pure Python (`cryptography` is a C extension and is
    banned by §1.1) and takes ~150-200 ms per signature. `publish_request` is called
    once per group member by `GroupService.submit_members`, in a loop, inside one HTTP
    request — so a 100-member batch spends ~20 s signing while the caller waits. That
    is accepted: a batch launch is an operator action, not a hot path. It is recorded
    here rather than discovered later, and a thread pool would not fix it (the GIL
    serialises pure-Python signing anyway). If signing ever becomes mandatory at
    scale, the fix is the `cryptography` dependency conversation, not concurrency.

    The number an operator actually hits: ~200 members is ~40 s, past a common 30 s
    client timeout. `POST /v0/groups` honours an `Idempotency-Key` header, so the
    retry after such a timeout returns the original batch instead of launching a
    second one — the failure is survivable, but only if the caller sends the header.
