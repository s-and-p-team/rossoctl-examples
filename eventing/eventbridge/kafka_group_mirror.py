"""Rebuild group state from the responses topic on every start. DESIGN_PHASE1 §21.2.

§21.2 claims the group lifecycle is "replayable from Kafka alone". It was not, in
practice: the live responses consumer uses a fixed group id and commits offsets, so
after a restart it resumes where it left off and never re-reads anything. With the test
overlay's `emptyDir` at /data that meant a new pod started with an empty store and every
earlier group returned 404 — while its two notifications had already been delivered, so
clicking one landed on "unknown groupid".

The same problem was already solved for prompts by `kafka_requests_mirror.py`, which
re-scans on every start. This does the same for groups, reading from the beginning to a
snapshot of the end offsets.

Two rules make the replay safe:

  * **It never publishes and never notifies.** A replay rebuilds state; it does not
    create new facts. `replay=True` suppresses the group-completed publish, which would
    otherwise send a duplicate notification for a batch that finished hours ago.
  * **It is one-shot.** It scans to the end of the topic and stops, rather than shadowing
    the live consumer forever. The live consumer owns everything from then on.

The one case where it does publish is a group the topic leaves unfinished: if EventBridge
died between the last member's terminal event and the `group.completed` it should have
written, that completion is missing from the topic and settling it is a new fact, not a
duplicate. `GroupService.maybe_complete` is once-only, so a group already completed on
the topic stays quiet.

Only group rows are rebuilt — `groups` and `group_members`. Response events are left to
the committing consumer, because re-inserting every response on every start is the cost
the committing consumer exists to avoid.
