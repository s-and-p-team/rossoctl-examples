"""KafkaConsumer thread — polls responses, writes SQLite, fans out to ntfy.

§11: this is where a response is checked against the approved-key set. Anything with
write access to the responses topic otherwise gets its output stored, rendered in the
transcript and pushed to the operator's phone **as a legitimate agent answer**.

A rejected event is stored as `phase="error"` rather than dropped. That is deliberate:
dropping it silently is indistinguishable from an agent that never answered, while
`phase="error"` reuses machinery already wired — a red card in the HTML transcript and
an ntfy priority-5 alert — so the forgery attempt is visible instead of invisible.

**What "reviewable" requires.** `Store.insert_response` derives both `data_json` and
`raw_json` from the single dict it is handed, so rewriting the envelope in place would
overwrite the evidence with the notice about it: the refused payload, the phase it
claimed, and the attributes the signature covered would all be gone, leaving a
signature that can no longer be checked against anything. The original is therefore
preserved under `data["rejected"]` — attrs, payload, claimed source and signature — so
an incident can be verified offline rather than merely logged.
