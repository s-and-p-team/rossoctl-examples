"""EventBridge's responses consumer: §11 verification, and the thread that must not die.

This module had no behavioural test at all before signing was wired — it was only
grepped as source text by `test_groups.py`. That mattered, because `kafka_in.run()`
decodes and writes to SQLite *outside* any `try`: anything that raises between the poll
and the store write ends the `for`, ends the `while`, and the consumer thread is gone
while the process stays up and the pod still reports healthy. A consumer that silently
stopped consuming is the worst failure this system has, so the verification path added
here has to degrade rather than raise — and that property needs a test, not a comment.

Most of what matters is decided by `signing.response_decision`, which is pure; those
tests live in `test_keyset.py`. What is left here is the part only the loop can show:
that a rejected event is stored rather than dropped, and that the loop survives.
