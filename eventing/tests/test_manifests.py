"""Manifest invariants. Gates T3.2 and T3.4 (DESIGN_PHASE1.md §20).

Two levels, because of a constraint worth stating: §1.1 bans `pyyaml` (it ships a
C extension), so there is no YAML parser available here, and
`kubectl apply -o json` needs API discovery — it is not offline. So:

  * offline checks use `kubectl kustomize` (which needs no cluster) and scope
    their assertions by document and by indentation;
  * structured checks ask the API server to render fully-defaulted JSON, which is
    the better fixture — it is what the cluster will actually store — and skip
    when no cluster is reachable.
